Currently, I focus on consultation sessions covering the following topics. If your issue doesn’t fall under these categories, feel free to email me at a.rashidbeigi [at] gmail.com.

### Interviews & Hiring

Over the years, I’ve worked with various companies, both Iranian and international, and have experience in candidate selection, interviewing, and hiring software engineers at junior, mid-level, and senior positions. If you're looking to get hired by different companies in Iran or abroad, or if you're recruiting for your team or company, you can book a session with me. Specifically, I can help with:

- **Increasing your chances of getting interviews:** Feedback on your resume, cover letter, and target company selection
- **Mock interviews and feedback:** Recruiter, technical (coding), system design, and behavioral mock interviews
- **Hiring new team members for software companies and teams**
