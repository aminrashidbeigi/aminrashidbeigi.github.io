I regularly hold **consultation sessions** (mentorship, one-on-one coaching, or whatever you prefer to call it) with individuals and companies in two main areas: **topic-focused consulting** and **career growth guidance**.

**Topic-focused consulting** covers areas that I’m currently focused on and actively studying. You can check the list of these topics [here](https://chatgpt.com/c/67dfcc3d-48e0-8002-8850-12ead3114cfc#topic-focused-consulting).

Apart from that, if you need guidance on topics not listed, we can schedule **career growth** sessions instead.

### How It Works

You can book a **free 15-minute initial session** to discuss your needs and challenges. If I can provide value and guidance in your case, we’ll discuss the next steps, including the structure, number of sessions, scheduling, and potential costs.

To request a free initial session, click the button below. Please include details about yourself, your background, and your goal for this session.

## **Topic-Focused Consulting**

I’m currently focusing on consultations related to the topics below. If your concern doesn’t fall under these categories, feel free to email me at **a.rashidbeigi [at] gmail.com**.

### **Job Interviews & Hiring**

Over the years, I’ve worked with various companies and have experience in candidate selection, conducting interviews, and making hiring decisions for **junior, mid-level, and senior software engineers**.

If you’re looking to get hired by companies, you can book a session with me.

More specifically, I can help with:
- **Improving your chances of landing interviews** – Resume and cover letter feedback, choosing the right target companies.
- **Mock interviews with feedback** – Recruiter screenings, technical interviews, system design, and behavioral (soft skills) interviews.
- **Hiring for software teams and companies** – Guidance on finding and selecting the right candidates.
