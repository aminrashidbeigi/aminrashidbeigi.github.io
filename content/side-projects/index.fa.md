### 🌎 Expedition Diaries
I love traveling, particularly when it comes to learning about new cultures. Additionally, I have always been curious about the cultures of nations throughout history.

Expedition Diaries aggregates all of this curiosity in one place, as it documents the journeys of explorers who have passed through lands throughout history.

### 🕸️ TarMaster
About 10 years ago, I began to join the webmasters community. I had little knowledge about websites and how they functioned, so I embarked on a challenging journey. At one point, I decided to share what I had learned with others like me who wanted to enter the vast world of web development. Therefore, I started Tar Master, with "Tar" meaning "Web" in Persian, thus signifying "WebMaster" in the language.
