      <title>Ways I Can Help</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I regularly hold &lt;strong&gt;consultation sessions&lt;/strong&gt; (mentorship, one-on-one coaching, or whatever you prefer to call it) with individuals and companies in two main areas: &lt;strong&gt;topic-focused consulting&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;career growth guidance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic-focused consulting&lt;/strong&gt; covers areas that I’m currently focused on and actively studying. You can check the list of these topics &lt;a href=&#34;https://chatgpt.com/c/67dfcc3d-48e0-8002-8850-12ead3114cfc#topic-focused-consulting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, if you need guidance on topics not listed, we can schedule &lt;strong&gt;career growth&lt;/strong&gt; sessions instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can book a &lt;strong&gt;free 15-minute initial session&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss your needs and challenges. If I can provide value and guidance in your case, we’ll discuss the next steps, including the structure, number of sessions, scheduling, and potential costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Am the First Reviewer of My Own Pull Requests</title>
      <link>https://aminrb.me/first-pull-request-reviewer/</link>

      <guid>https://aminrb.me/first-pull-request-reviewer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About ten years ago, I started my career as a backend intern at a small company. Back then, the main product our team was working on was a multilingual hotel management software. After spending some time watching tutorials and practicing, the tech lead decided I was ready to contribute to the main project, so I officially joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I completed my first task, I nervously sent my pull request to my manager. Before even opening it, he asked, &amp;ldquo;Did you review it yourself?&amp;rdquo; I was a bit surprised and said no. He told me to go review my own code first, fix any issues that you found, and then send it back to me. He also suggested that I do these reviews before committing my code and introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/a&gt;
 for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Navigating Extra Work in Programming Teams</title>
      <link>https://aminrb.me/extra-work/</link>

      <guid>https://aminrb.me/extra-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read an interesting article by Ben Northrop that can be found &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2021/always-do-extra.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;. In the article, Ben talks about the concept of &amp;lsquo;doing extra,&amp;rsquo; which is not the same as doing more. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re asked to implement two APIs and finish early, you can use the extra time to think about how to make the implementation more efficient, secure, or reduce the code length. That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;doing extra.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improve Onboarding through the Magic of Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://aminrb.me/onboarding-storytelling/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 01:44:04 +0330</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aminrb.me/onboarding-storytelling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you join a new team, you are usually bombarded with a lot of information. You need to familiarize yourself with the company&amp;rsquo;s culture, facilities, and colleagues. Initially, the onboarding process tends to be welcoming and hospitable. However, after a few days, you are expected to quickly learn about the products, services, and data in order to contribute effectively. It can be overwhelming to try to absorb and utilize all of this information, and eventually, the honeymoon phase ends, leaving you feeling stressed and concerned about your credibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Engineering Managers Can Avoid Technical Decay</title>
      <link>https://aminrb.me/engineering-managers-avoid-technical-decay/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an engineering manager, it can be easy to feel a sense of distance from the team and concerns about technical decay over time. But there are solutions to this problem! In this article, I explore ways to improve low-level engineering skills, in order to reduce the gap between you and your team members and maintain effectiveness in leading a technical team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading a lot (mostly on how things work and why they were created), re-doing (for yourself) technical design reviews, and having side projects can help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here, you can find some of my side projects, which I had a great time building. Even though most of them are no longer alive, they greatly impacted my career, and I am really proud of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-expedition-diaries&#34;&gt;🌎 Expedition Diaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love traveling, particularly when it comes to learning about new cultures. Additionally, I have always been curious about the cultures of nations throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedition Diaries aggregates all of this curiosity in one place, as it documents the journeys of explorers who have passed through lands throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
