      <description>As an engineering manager, it can be easy to feel a sense of distance from the team and concerns about technical decay over time. But there are solutions to this problem! In this article, I explore ways to improve low-level engineering skills, in order to reduce the gap between you and your team members and maintain effectiveness in leading a technical team.
Reading a lot (mostly on how things work and why they were created), re-doing (for yourself) technical design reviews, and having side projects can help.</description>

      <description>🌎 Expedition Diaries I love traveling, particularly when it comes to learning about new cultures. Additionally, I have always been curious about the cultures of nations throughout history.
Expedition Diaries aggregates all of this curiosity in one place, as it documents the journeys of explorers who have passed through lands throughout history.
