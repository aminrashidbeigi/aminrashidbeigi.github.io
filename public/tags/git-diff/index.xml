      <title>I Am the First Reviewer of My Own Pull Requests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About ten years ago, I started my career as a backend intern at a small company. Back then, the main product our team was working on was a multilingual hotel management software. After spending some time watching tutorials and practicing, the tech lead decided I was ready to contribute to the main project, so I officially joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I completed my first task, I nervously sent my pull request to my manager. Before even opening it, he asked, &amp;ldquo;Did you review it yourself?&amp;rdquo; I was a bit surprised and said no. He told me to go review my own code first, fix any issues that you found, and then send it back to me. He also suggested that I do these reviews before committing my code and introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;git diff&lt;/a&gt;
 for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
