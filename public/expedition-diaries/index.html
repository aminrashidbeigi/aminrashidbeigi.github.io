I had experience in each of these areas separately but never had the chance to develop them together. Plus, I had different goals for each part:\nBackend (Go): I wanted to experiment with various libraries and architectures. Frontend (Vue.js): I wanted to refresh my knowledge. I also thought about giving React a try. Infrastructure: I was less experienced in this area and wanted to experience and learn some. Expedition Diaries One thing that mattered most to me was to create something useful, both for myself and others, and not just let it sit on my GitHub archive.\nSo, I went through my idea list to find a project that aligned with my goals. I’ve always been fascinated by old travelogues. I love discovering who passed through different lands and seas, what they observed, and what was going through their minds. But finding this information isn’t easy.
